A DOCKERIZED DJANGO PROJECT RUNNING CI/CD PIPELINE THROUGH GITHUB ACTIONS. Messaging will be using  Celery with rabbitmq as broker. Still trying to decide between Docker or Vagrant for containerization. Some interesting points new features I am thinking of before going live includes adding a sytem to accept coupons for cheapening prices common in almost every e-commerce business. Also adding localizations especially translations might be some good features. This are the next steps at the moment.
